## What it does
Hyperlink.cash is the easiest way to send crypto. No need to ask for anyone's address or permission. **Just send it!â„¢** all you need to do is to go through the [getting started guild](https://hyperlink.cash/getting-started/), and you will have a good idea of what it does and how it works.

# How I build it

This project is built with simplicity in mind, so everything is built using HTML ES6 without a build tool to compress or minimize the source code for maximum readability. There might be some centralized services like Infura, Alchemy, and CDN providers. Hopefully, in the future, we will slowly replace these with a more decentralized option. There are only two libraries we use Ether.js and bignumber.js.

# Challenges we ran into

We have to build most of our web apps using ES6 without building tools or frameworks; it challenges code organization and abstraction. Also, state management using just JavaScript is a tall order, but I manage to work it out while maintaining simplicity in the codebase as much as possible.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Hyperlink.cash is one of it kind DApp that will help many people get their hands on DEFI. This app will help gain public interest by making crypto more accessible to the masses.

# What I have learned

I have learned about URL fragment, what it is and how it works. This is crucial to making sure that the private key of the user never got sent outside of their device.

I learn that most web3 library is not written in JavaScript but in TypeScript, which is good for type safety but make it hard to read the source code and verify library correctness. Maybe in the future, we might need a decentralized CDN to deliver standardize on-chain web3 library for shared security so that everyone doesn't have to vet every library on every Dapp they encounter.

I realize how many centralized API I need in order to create a Dapp, which leads to censorship and vulnerability. The [upcoming feature](https://hyperlink.cash/road-map/) to compare data from multiple APIs will help reduce trust and centrality.

## What's next for Hyperlink.cash

The strong point of hyperlink.cash is it is like a mini wallet, so building or integrating a new type of asset is easy, whether it is NFT that requires a specific type of metadata to render a new type of digital asset. Not everyone has to own or build a wallet of their own.
So we will focus on support and many asset and chain as much as we can.

Right now, we are in MVP mode, so the code base is a bit hard to scale. There need to be major refactoring to support multi-chain multi-asset

We strongly believe in decentralization we will continue to make sure there is no centralization in any of our services.
