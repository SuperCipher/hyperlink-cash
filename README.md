# What is it
Opensource, free forever, privacy focus and unify multi asset multi network in to one simple way to transact an asset.

## Goal

Prioritize in this specific order

### 1. Simple
One click to claim asset. No Blockchain or wallet knowledge require.

### 2. Permissionless
No need to communicate back and forth about address or network of the receiver.

**Just send it!â„¢** like a cash. When you want to give someone your cash you don't need to ask for their home address or if that person have a wallet.

### 3. Transparent
All of the source codes are readable. Most wallets are compressed or built so that the source code is not easily readable.

NOT US!

Our source code is written in simple es6 and html no framework and minimizes library usage so anyone can inspect and read our software easily in real time.

### 4. Trust minimize
Our upcoming feature is to make library file readable is es6 as well and have multiple api aggregations and comparison also have our website be pinned on ipfs or Filecoin
