# About

There was a time when I wanted to introduce people to blockchain and give them a small number of tokens as a gift to motivate them to learn more.

It is pretty cumbersome that I have to tell them to install a wallet and give me their address.

Even though blockchain is permissionless, why can't I just send someone the token just like when I give someone cash? Just sent it... handed it to them without having to ask for anything. And this gets even worse with complex assets, e.g., NFT, synthetic assets, and non-standardized assets.

This is not sustainable people shouldn't have to download a new wallet every time they want to own an asset or security or Signup to centralize a platform just to manage their decentralized assets or ask someone to Signup to centralize the platform to receive some gift from me.

In order to solve this user experience problem, I came up with a simple solution called Hyperlink.cash
