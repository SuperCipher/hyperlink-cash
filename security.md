# Security
Security is a spectrum between Security and Convenience the more security the less convenience and vice versa.

If I have to list all the wallet base on security from highest to lowest would look like this
1. Paper wallet
2. Hardware wallet
3. Mobile app wallet
4. Browser wallet
5. Hyperlink.cash wallet

But if I have to list all the wallet base on convenience simplicity transparency the order would be flipped.
